# LangChain SQL Workflow

This document explores the capabilities of **LangChain**, a framework designed to streamline large language model (LLM) workflows, specifically focusing on building an SQL chain using the **gemma-2b LLM**.

## Overview

**LangChain** provides a seamless way to interact with SQL databases using the power of large language models. By leveraging SQL, users can securely query and manipulate data stored in CSV files.

## Methodology

1. **Installation**: Install the required libraries.
2. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data handling and LangChain functionality.
3. **Setting the Environment**: Authenticate with the Hugging Face token for accessing models.
4. **Loading CSV Data into SQL Database**: Load CSV data into an SQLite database for SQL queries.
5. **Interacting with SQL Database**: Execute SQL queries to interact with the data stored in the database.
6. **Building SQL Chain**: Set up the SQL chain using LangChain, connecting the LLM with the SQL database.
7. **Trying it Out**: Test the SQL chain by querying the database using natural language.

## Conclusion

**LangChain** offers a convenient and secure way to work with SQL databases using large language models. By incorporating SQL into LLM workflows, users can streamline data analysis and manipulation tasks efficiently.
